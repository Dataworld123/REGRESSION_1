    "Ridge Regression, also known as Tikhonov regularization, is a linear regression technique used for prediction when there is multicollinearity among the predictor variables. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated, which can lead to unstable and unreliable estimates of the regression coefficients in ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.\n",

    "Yes, Ridge Regression can be used for feature selection to some extent, although its primary purpose is regularization to handle multicollinearity. The regularization term in Ridge Regression penalizes the magnitude of the coefficients, and as a result, it can lead to some coefficients being exactly zero, effectively excluding certain features from the model. However, Ridge Regression doesn't perform variable selection as aggressively as methods like Lasso Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Ridge Regression contributes to feature selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Shrinkage of Coefficients: The regularization term in Ridge Regression adds a penalty based on the squared magnitude of the coefficients. This penalty tends to shrink the coefficients towards zero but rarely exactly to zero. As a result, Ridge Regression tends to keep all variables in the model but with smaller, more balanced coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Multicollinearity: Ridge Regression is particularly useful when dealing with multicollinearity, where predictor variables are highly correlated. In the presence of multicollinearity, OLS estimates can be highly sensitive and unstable. Ridge Regression helps to stabilize the estimates by shrinking the coefficients, making it more robust in the presence of correlated predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous Shrinkage: The amount of shrinkage applied by Ridge Regression is continuous, meaning that as the regularization parameter (\n",
    "�\n",

    "\n",
    "To achieve more explicit feature selection, where some coefficients are exactly zero, you might consider Lasso Regression. Lasso adds an L1 penalty term to the objective function, which tends to produce sparse models by forcing some coefficients to be exactly zero. This property makes Lasso Regression a more aggressive method for feature selection compared to Ridge Regression.\n",
